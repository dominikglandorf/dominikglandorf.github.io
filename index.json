[{"content":"I like both the problem and the solution. This is why I studied Psychology and Computer Science. Learning is a fascinating and complex process I want to understand and improve using the modern toolbox of quantitative methods. These tools are classical statistics, gradient-based, hierarchical function approximators (neural networks), including language models.\nResearch # Under the supervision of Christian Fischer and Renzhe Yu, I investigated Machine Learning models for student dropout prediction in higher education. Our work will be presented at LAK24 in March. Previously, I worked on the creation of Knowledge Graphs with Álvaro Tejero-Cantero in the ML Science Colaboratory. With Sascha Schroeder, I improved the preprocessing of eye-tracking for psychological studies of reading acquisition. At the Hasso Plattner institute, I investigated the data-privacy-compliant integration of third-party educational resources into cloud learning platforms using a pseudonymization approach.

Therefore, I investigated whether transformer-based embeddings represent grammar and text generation can be controlled in terms of grammar.
